IMPORTANT: You MUST UNSUBSCRIBE from the official version of JecsTools - unfortunately, their subscriptions are mutually exclusive. You will get a warning about duplicate packageId if you are subscribed to both versions (packageId is not changed for mod compatibility reasons).

This is an unofficial version of JecsTools with performance improvements, and misc fixes/cleanup/improvements, including explicit RimWorld 1.2 support. I will not guarantee active support of this, and this version may be taken down upon request by Jecrell (if/when he returns).
